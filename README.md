# rick-react
This project was created using JavaScript, Reactjs and React-Router-DOM, TailwindCSS and ChartJs.
In this app you will find a complete list of characters from rick and morty, 
you can watch them all page by page or look for one specific character using 
the searcihg bar I created.
It also comes with different pages that catch information of the existing places and episodes of the show.
And lastly an automatic graph that shows the genders and status of the characters, 
plus a graph that shows the mortality of each episode.
(it will auto update the stats of the graph in case the info in the API changes)
